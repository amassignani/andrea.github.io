      Well...Its a long video, itsn't it? BUT It shows me  how we can be a bit estressed at the begining.
      <br>For me its a BIG thing to back study again after 20 years, also my English can be limited but i will do my best.

      This is my second time al the phase 'zero' and I am feeling very positive that I can finish that well.
