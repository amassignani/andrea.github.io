    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
          <p>I learnd that Emotional Inteligence is trainable. The idea is that what we think, do, and pay attention to changes the struture and function of our brains.<br>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?<br>Focus on an aspect of my breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into my nostrils and out of my mouth, or my belly rising and falling as I inhale and exhale.
