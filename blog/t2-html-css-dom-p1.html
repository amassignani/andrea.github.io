    <h2>Html, CSS & Dom.</h2>
    <h3>Part One</h3>
    <h4>How the websites works?</h4>
    <p>If I have to explain to my non-technical friend, I will start to compering the Html,CSS and doc as my house...<br>
    Html is like the structure of my house:<br>
    Where the walls is place, what room  is my living-room, kitchen, bathroom.<br>
    CSS is the style:
    What color of the walls and the decorations I want to place<br>
    Dom is the tools:
    How could you put all this toguether whitout tools,rigth.<br>
    What is meant by boxifying design and box model?<br>
    Turning every element on my websit as boxes, that way is easy to visualise the areas and work on it. Content, picture, navegation, if you think it a box its easy to work on it</p>
