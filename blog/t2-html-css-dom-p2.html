    <h3>Part Two</h3>
    <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
    <p>Grids are like the glue that holds a design together.The purpose of a grid is to establish a set of guidelines for how elements should be positioned within a layout.<br>
    Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?<br>Responsive design isn’t just about making your page display properly on any device, you also have to make it function well – and that means it has to be good at accepting input in a world where desktops have touchscreens and phones have keyboards.<br>
    What is semantic structure?<br> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.</p>
